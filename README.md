# Hybrid-Balance GFlowNet for Solving Vehicle Routing Problems

Our paper is accepted by NeurIPS 2025.

The proposed HBG framework is compatible with existing GFlowNet-based solvers, including [GFACS](https://github.com/ai4co/gfacs/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file) and [AGFN](https://github.com/ZHANG-NI/AGFN ). All datasets used in our experiments are derived from the([AGFN/data at main Â· ZHANG-NI/AGFN](https://github.com/ZHANG-NI/AGFN/tree/main/data.

#### Training

```bash
python train_tb+db.py $N -p "path_to_checkpoint"
```

$N is the nodes of the instances

#### Testing

```bash
python train_tb+db.py $N -p "path_to_checkpoint"
```

$N is the nodes of the instances
